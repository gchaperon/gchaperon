## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gabriel Chaperon, a Software Engineer from [Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago). 


Professionaly I've worked in backend services using AWS and the Serverless framework, doing mobile development using React Native, migratig RoR apps to a microservice based architecture on GCP, and also doing research in NLP, among others.

In my free time I like learning new stuff and trying my best to keep up with the advances in AI  (deep learning mostly), and what better way to accomplish both goals than to replicate papers! See my projects further below for examples of papers i've implemented.

## Projects

### Paper implementations
These are papers I've implemented in my free time mostly.

* [Neural State Machine](https://github.com/gchaperon/neural-state-machine)
* [Pointer Networks](https://github.com/gchaperon/pointer-networks)
* [Alexnet](https://github.com/gchaperon/alexnet)


### Learning
I also like learning new languages or dive deeper into ones I know only a little bit. So here are repost where I track my progress and exercises.

* [The C Programming Language](https://github.com/gchaperon/the-c-programming-language)


## Misc Info
* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multimodal and generative models (CLIP, Stable Diffusion, etc)
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about image processing tasks, like classification, object detection, desgmentation, etc.
* ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on replicating state-of-the art papers
* ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Terraform!
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about NLP!
* ðŸ“« How to reach me: email! See in my short bio on the left.
